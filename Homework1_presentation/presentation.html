    Hi, I am Diana Shekhter. I am here in Israel already 13 years ( still can't belive, it was like yesterday). <br>
    I have passion to learn something new about technology, this text I am writing by myselg, but if I will ask
    OpenAI to assist here, this text can be much much nicer. Maybe next time)) <br>  Many years I am working as QA engeener,
    but always was interesting how to be on other side, be person who not surching for a bugs, be a person who creates them
    (joking :)). <br> This what bring me to this course and hope I will made it.  I love what I am doing and my job is my passion.
